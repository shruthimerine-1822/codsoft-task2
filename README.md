HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play pivotal roles in shaping the functionality and appearance of this personal portfolio. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structural foundation, defining the various sections of the portfolio such as the header, about me, skills, projects, resume, and contact. It organizes content in a semantic and accessible manner, laying the groundwork for a user-friendly experience. html code is in index.html file

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is instrumental in styling the portfolio, controlling the layout, colors, and overall aesthetics. It enhances the visual appeal by ensuring a cohesive and polished design, as seen in the header, sections, and footer.reference code is in style.css


JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic features to the portfolio. Although not extensively used in this example, JavaScript can be leveraged to create interactive elements, such as modal pop-ups for project details or form validation in the contact section. Together, these technologies form a powerful trio, allowing developers to create well-structured, visually appealing, and interactive web applications, making a lasting impression on visitors to the portfolio. reference code is in script.js
